Spyder was used for coding.

The libraries used are Pandas for data collection and assigning binary values to categorical attribute. Seaborn for Visualisation and data analysis. And sklearn for Machine learning algorithm selection.

The process starts with gathering the data from kaggle on secondhand car dataset.

Checking for any missing values. And replace the columns reps, product,region as they are categorical variable into 0 for not the actual variable and 1 for the actual variable

Selecting independent variables in x array i.e reps,product,qty,region. And dependent variables or target variable to y array i.e revenue. Since the target variable is continuous Linear Regression is planned to be used for prediction.

Split universal dataset to trainset and testset using library sklearn,module:model_selection, class : train_test_split. Test size of 0.3 was used with random state of 2500. The train set was named x_train, y_train and test set was assigned as x_test, y_test.

Linear regression was used as Algorithm Selection for training and predicting the y_test named as y_pred. Using the Library: sklearn, module : Linear_model, class : LinearRegression.

Checking the accuracy of y_train andy_pred was done using the Library: sklearn, module : metrics, class : r2score
